I'm excited for my final project- words I wrote before my entire program fell
apart.

Before my files got overwritten, my game was two parts. You'd have to make
it through the goombas by jumping on them or dodging them, and then you'd
face the King Bob-omb. And it was really super cool because I had yoshi 
sticking his tongue out, visibly catching the mini bob-ombs, and then holding
them in his mouth with like a whole other set of sprites where his cheeks
were red and puffed out. And then I also had him throwing them at the King
Bob-omb who had a health bar too(getting that extra sex appeal)! It was like 
a showdown, and it looked so good, and then I ruined it. 

And then I tried to rebuild what I had lost, and failed because I'd only slept
about 3 hours during the 2 days prior to the massive meltdown, so I couldn't
code very well. As I write this, it's been about 3 days on 3 hours of sleep, and
I think I ended up with something passable, but definitely not what I wanted.
I tried to get the menu working, but it would segfault in my engine.cpp loop
that allowed bounce on the first if statement to check for the right arrow
key, so I had to give that up too.

I really want to finish my game, and I've had a great time this semester and
learned a lot, which is what really counts.

I just wish I could show you my original game, because it was awesome.
